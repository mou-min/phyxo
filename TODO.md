# Things to do

-   Remove useless arobase in code
-   Remove stripslashes/addslashes in code
-   Move more code (classes) to Phyxo namespace
-   sanitize notification_by_mail
-   Move upgrade.php and upgrade_feed.php to admin/
-   Remove/refactoring of action.php script

-   Add more tests (unit and functional)
-   Behat/Mink tests :

    -   use ID everywhere instead of names
    -   use more friendly assertion (example: see modal instead of see #cboxWrapper)

-   Check modifiers(translation, explode, ternary) in template class

-   Find a way to provide simple menu categories and recursive one but not both
-   Give better user experience in case of upgrade in minor or major version. Display a real page not an almost blank page.
-   Fix use of PHPWG_ROOT_PATH that is used for filesystem root path and URL path
