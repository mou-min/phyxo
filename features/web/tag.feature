  In order to find image in the gallery
  As a user
  I need to be able to find them by tags

  Background: init
    Given a user:
      | username | password | status    |
      | user1    | pass1    | normal    |
      | user2    | pass2    | webmaster |
    And albums:
      | name    |
      | album 1 |
      | album 2 |
    And images:
      | file                     | name    | album   | tags    |
      | features/media/img_1.png | photo 1 | album 1 | t1      |
      | features/media/img_2.png | photo 2 | album 1 | t2      |
      | features/media/img_3.png | photo 3 | album 2 | [t1,t2] |
      | features/media/img_4.png | photo 4 | album 2 | [t1,t3] |
      | features/media/img_5.png | photo 5 | album 2 | t5      |
    Then save "image_id"
    And user "user1" can access "album 1"
    And user "user1" can access "album 2"
    And user "user2" can access "album 1"
    And user "user2" can access "album 2"
